Hi!

I am Abel Mathew. I am a passionate open-source and community enthusiast. In addition, I am a self-taught developer interested in collaborating with others to implement robust features. As a Physics major by University curriculum, I have been actively involved in communities and projects centred on tech due to my immense interest in the field. 

**What am I up to in these days?**

I am guiding hackers in hackathons as a mentor.
Writing articles, and planning to write more.
Working on random projects, attending events and participating in hackathons.
